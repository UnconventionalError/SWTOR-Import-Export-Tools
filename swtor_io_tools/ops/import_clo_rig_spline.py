# <pep8 compliant>

"""
Spline IK / Bendy Bone layer for "Build Rig" mode -- applied on top of a finished
armature from import_clo_rig.py's build(). Deliberately kept separate from that module:
this only needs to decide which unbranched bone runs exist and lay curves/constraints
over them, none of the Dijkstra/endParticle/pruning machinery that makes up most of
import_clo_rig.py's complexity -- a genuinely separate concern.

Key design decision: chain selection ALWAYS uses the weighted-bone-only hierarchy, the
same one skip_unweighted_bones=True would produce -- regardless of what that checkbox is
actually set to for this particular build. If it's off, the built armature still contains
the unweighted stub bones (plain FK, untouched), but they're never considered part of a
spline/bendy chain and never split one. This module re-derives that hierarchy itself
(via _find_pins/_find_unweighted_bones/_seed_pins/_spanning_tree_from_pins/_effective_parent,
reused as-is from import_clo_rig.py) rather than trusting build()'s own effective_parent_of,
because that dict reflects whatever the checkbox actually was -- with it off, pruned bones
stay in the graph during tree-building too (not just added back afterward), which can
genuinely change which bone is whose primary/effective parent, not just add extra leaves.
Verified against all three of this build's sample files: pruning removes 10/20 bones on
the twi'lek head, 4/32 on the cape, 0/56 on the shawl, and in every case the survivors form
clean unbranched root-to-tip runs -- see chat for the exact chains. A fork surviving
pruning hasn't been observed on any real file yet, but the branch-splitting logic below is
still there as a documented, deliberate fallback rather than an unhandled case.

Branch handling (confirmed against the twi'lek lekku's pre-pruning shape, which *did* fork,
even though pruning removes the fork on that specific file): every unbranched run --
including the trunk above a fork -- becomes its own independent curve + Spline IK
constraint. None of them share continuity across a fork; a branch's curve still starts
positionally at the fork bone (so there's no visual gap) but is mechanically unrelated to
the trunk's own curve/constraint.
