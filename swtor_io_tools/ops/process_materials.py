.mat-by-Name Materials Processing.

Builds real "Atroxa Shaders" native materials for existing Blender
materials purely by matching their *name* against a real .mat file on
disk -- entirely independent of any Jedipedia NPC/Character json data.
Two entry points share this module's pipeline:

- Automatic (7a): apply_materials_by_name_after_import(), called by
  ops/import_gr2.py's load() right after a genuine standalone .gr2
  import (never the NPC/Character (.json) importer's own internal gr2
  loads -- see that module's gating for why).
- Manual (7b): the three swtor.apply_materials_by_name* operators below
  plus their Shift+A submenu entry, appended onto the live (non-
  deprecated) NODE_MT_swtor_shaders_menu, mirroring ops/migrate_shaders.
  py's exact precedent for the deprecated system's own submenu.

Both funnel through _build_named_material(): Tier 1 (types/mat.py's
read_mat_summary -- alpha + skip-list + shader-family aliasing) + Tier 2
(types/mat.py's read_mat_full -- the map/palette adapter) +
ops/import_cha.py's existing get_or_create_material(), unchanged.

Deliberately does lazy (function-body), not top-level, imports from
ops/import_cha.py: import_cha.py imports ops/import_gr2.py's load() at
module level, and this module is imported by import_gr2.py's load() (to
call apply_materials_by_name_after_import()) too -- a top-level import
here would create an import cycle (import_gr2 -> process_materials ->
import_cha -> import_gr2). Deferred imports sidestep it, since by the
time any function below actually runs, every module in the cycle has
already finished loading.
