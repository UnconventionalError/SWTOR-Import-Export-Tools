Real per-light building for Area Assembler's ".lit" elements -- Case 1
only (a direct ".lit" element carrying its own "light" JSON data; see
types/area.py's LightInfo docstring for why Case 2, a ".lit" reached
via ".spn_p" -> ".dyn" expansion, never reaches this module at all and
keeps using ops/import_area.py's existing generic placeholder path).

Sits directly on top of types/light_templates.py (the append/dedup
mechanics) -- this module is the piece that actually knows what a room
json's "light" object means: which JSON field goes to which node/
socket/property, how a batch-wide cache key is built so identical
lights across a whole import share one Light data-block, and how a
.dds texture path gets resolved and loaded against this addon's own
Resources Directory convention.

Deliberately imports _apply_transform/_build_placeholder_light FROM
ops/import_area.py rather than the reverse -- see that module's own
top-of-file note on why it only ever imports THIS module back via a
function-local deferred import, same cycle-avoidance reasoning already
established there for ops/import_fxspec.py.

# CONFIRMED REAL-BLENDER-TESTING BUG, fixed here: an AREA light built
# from the template, positioned via the exact same _apply_transform()
# every other element type already uses, came out shining straight up
# (ceiling-ward) instead of down (floor-ward) -- a full 180 degree
# flip, not a coordinate-convention problem in the general transform
# pipeline itself (unchanged, shared with every other element type,
# and already proven correct for all of them). Blender's own hard rule
# that an AREA light always shines along its OWN local -Z axis is what
# actually differs here -- nothing else this addon builds has an
# inherent "facing direction" tied to one specific local axis the way
# a Light does, so this is the first element type where that mismatch
# could even show up. Applied as a local-space rotation, composed
# AFTER _apply_transform()'s own world rotation in
# _process_light_element() below -- correcting "which way this
# object's own local -Z points" is independent of where in the room
# it's been placed/faced.
#
# Axis picked as X -- a specific choice, not "doesn't matter which":
# if the falloff/illumination cookie ends up visibly mirrored
# left-right versus up-down once compared against real SWTOR lighting,
# that's this needing to be 'Y' instead (a 180 degree flip about X vs.
# Y both correct the up/down shine direction identically, but mirror
# the rectangle's own texture-mapped footprint differently) -- flag it
# back and it's a one-line change. CONFIRMED correct via real testing
# (Crunch: "the gobo rotation we did on the light seems to be fine").
_ORIENTATION_CORRECTION_AXIS = 'X'
_ORIENTATION_CORRECTION_RADIANS = math.pi

# REVERSED, confirmed wrong via real Blender testing: this used to
# force every real light's Spread to math.pi (180 degrees), reasoning
# that the template's own baked-in 0 was a leftover/unset value rather
# than deliberate. It wasn't -- Crunch's own testing with actual
# gobo/cookie-textured lights showed 180 degrees blows the cookie
# pattern out entirely, and 0 degrees (a tight, coherent beam, which
# is the whole point of a "gobo" -- a narrow, directional projector,
# same as the theatrical fixture it's named after) is what actually
# renders the illuminationMap texture as a recognizable projected
# pattern. Every real light observed so far DOES carry an
# illuminationMap (100% of a 1625-light sample), so there's no
# observed case needing anything other than 0 -- set explicitly
# (rather than just leaving the template's own value untouched) so a
# future template re-export changing that default doesn't silently
# change this addon's own behavior without it being obvious here.

# from the bundled template's OWN authored demo values (light.energy
# was 10.0 against the shared group's own default strength of 1.2,
# confirmed via node dump) rather than invented from nothing, but
# still a GUESS, not verified against any real SWTOR reference
# lighting yet (Crunch's own call: "guess one to start... we'll refine
# as we go"). The Cycles path (the shared group's own "strength"
# socket) doesn't need this conversion factor at all -- it takes
# `intensity` directly, 1:1, since that same template default (1.2)
# sits right in the middle of the observed real intensity range
# (0.3-1.3).
#
# REVERSED, confirmed wrong via real Blender testing: both this AND
# strength used to also get scale_factor multiplied in, reasoning that
# a fixed intensity value "becomes visually meaningless once the whole
# scene has been scaled up" (matching _LightCache's own point-light
# precedent). Real testing showed the opposite of "too low" -- going
# above the template's own defaults (strength > 1.2, energy > 10)
# blows the cookie out and loses the pattern entirely, the same
# failure mode as forcing Spread to 180 above. In hindsight this makes
# physical sense: Strength/Emission represent RADIANCE (intensity per
# unit area), not total power -- unlike a POINT light (which has no
# inherent size, so scaling its Watts is the only available "make it
# look right at a different scale" knob), an AREA light's own PHYSICAL
# SIZE already carries scale_factor once that's correctly applied to
# the light Object itself (see _process_light_element's own
# scale_factor handling below, mirroring _process_fxspec_element's
# established anchor.scale pattern) -- a physically bigger light
# emitting the SAME radiance naturally puts more total light into a
# proportionally bigger room, with no need to also inflate the
# radiance value itself. The actual "power looks too low" symptom
# reported earlier was root-caused to the light Object's own scale
# never getting scale_factor applied at all (real lights were
# importing ~10x too small), not to strength/energy being too low --
# see that fix in _process_light_element.
