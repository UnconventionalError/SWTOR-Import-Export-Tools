"""
"Build Rig" mode for the .clo importer: turns a parsed Cloth object (see import_clo.py
for the reader) into a real, positioned, posable armature.

This is the module all the hard-won design decisions from actually testing against SWTOR
Slicers' real .clo files live in. Summary, in the order they mattered:

  - A .clo file is a mass-spring CLOTH MESH, not a bone chain (edges[], where most
    particles connect to 2-4 neighbours -- structural/shear/bend springs -- not one).
    bone.parent names the single real skeleton bone a particle borrows its local
    coordinate frame from -- true for every bone, but only load-bearing (a genuine rigid
    attachment) for the small subset that are actually PINNED (invertedSimWeight ~= 1).
    So the rig is rooted at pins, not at every bone.parent reference.

  - Plain hop-count BFS from the pins isn't enough to build the tree: real files have
    dense cross-bracing alongside the primary structural edges, so a bone can be equally
    few hops from a genuine structural edge and an incidental brace. Weighting by
    restLength (Dijkstra) fixes that in most cases.

  - bone.startParticle/endParticle directly names each bone's own designated structural
    partner and is treated as AUTHORITATIVE where unambiguous -- applied as a direct
    override after Dijkstra runs, not just a weight discount (Dijkstra's shortest path is
    undirected, so even a heavily discounted edge can still be reached from the wrong end
    via an unrelated cheap detour elsewhere in the graph). A real edges[] entry is NOT
    required for a single-claimant target, but IS used as a tiebreak once a target has
    multiple competing claimants.

  - Pruned (unweighted) bones are excluded from the graph entirely before the tree is
    built, not just skipped when creating the final edit bones -- routing another bone's
    parent assignment through a bone that won't exist in the final rig can corrupt an
    unrelated, otherwise-correct chain that merely passes near it.

  - Multiple true pins sharing a real parent get reduced to one Dijkstra seed only when
    one pin's own endParticle unambiguously names another pin -- not merely for sharing a
    real parent and being graph-connected (that broader rule was tried and reverted: it
    incorrectly merged genuinely independent strands that just happened to share a real
    bone and sit in the same connected component).

  - Standalone builds get one placeholder bone per DISTINCT real-parent name (not per
    pin), each independently constrainable to the real skeleton -- not a single master
    bone standing in for every pin, which would make independently-moving anchors (e.g. a
    cape pinned at both the collar and the knee) move together incorrectly. An optional
    extra convenience bone can sit above all the placeholders for a single grab point,
    controlled by the "Add Master Bone" operator option.

See the chat history this add-on was built in for the full worked examples (twi'lek
lekku, several capes/robes/shawls) that motivated each of the above.

    Multi-source Dijkstra over the edges[] graph, seeded from every pin at once, so each

    (they're roots). Bones unreachable from any pin (should be rare -- none seen across 6
    real files so far) are left out of the dict entirely and fall back to flat real-bone
    parenting by the caller.

    Plain hop-count BFS isn't enough: real files have dense cross-bracing (shear/bend
    springs) alongside the primary structural edges, and a bone can end up EQUALLY few
    hops away via a short genuine structural edge or a much longer incidental brace --
    verified on a real file where a bone had 7 edges, and hop-count BFS picked a 0.021
    cross-brace over the correct 0.011 structural edge one hop earlier, purely because of
    dict/queue ordering. Weighting by restLength makes "nearest" mean physically nearest,
    which is what actually distinguishes a structural edge from a brace in most files.

    bone.startParticle/endParticle turns out to directly name each bone's own designated
    structural partner -- verified against every previously-confirmed-correct chain across
    all 6 files, with zero exceptions -- so those claims are treated as AUTHORITATIVE,
    applied as a direct override after Dijkstra runs rather than just a weight discount.
    A discount alone isn't sufficient: Dijkstra's shortest path is undirected, so even a
    heavily discounted edge can still be reached "from the wrong end" via some unrelated
    cheap detour elsewhere in the graph -- verified on a real file where a pruned side
    branch gave a false shortcut into the middle of an otherwise-correct chain, partially
    reversing it. Only UNAMBIGUOUS claims (exactly one bone names a given target) are
    trusted, and a cycle guard skips any claim that would loop back on itself (not seen on
    any real file, but would otherwise strand a whole chain with no root).

    UNWEIGHTED (pruned) bones are excluded from the graph entirely, not just skipped when
    creating the final bones -- letting a path route THROUGH a bone that won't exist in
    the final rig produces wrong results even for OTHER, unrelated bones: that's exactly
    the false-shortcut case above, where the pruned side branch's own particles happened
    to form a short-cut that was numerically nearest.
