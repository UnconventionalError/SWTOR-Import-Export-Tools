"""
Merged SWTOR NPC/Character importer created by Crunch.

Replaces the old import_cha.py (IO Scene GR2) + char_character_assembler.py
(ZG_Tools) split. Reads directly from a local "resources" folder (mirroring
the game's extracted asset layout) instead of copying assets into a
per-character folder first.

Targets Jedipedia.net's json export format exclusively.
No support for older TORC exports with none planned.

    Parses a Jedipedia-formatted NPC/PC json file.

    This is a pure parser: it doesn't touch the resources folder, doesn't
    validate that the file "looks like" a character file, and doesn't
    raise on a missing "meta" entry (current live Jedipedia exports don't
    emit one yet) — callers decide how to handle those cases.

    Returns:
        meta:
            Dict of the parsed "meta" entry's fields (charType, charName,
            nppPath, bodyType, errors). Empty dict if no "meta" entry is
            present. bodyType drives skeleton resolution -- see
            import_skeleton()'s docstring for how.

        slots:
            Dict mapping slotName -> ordered list of raw entry dicts, in
