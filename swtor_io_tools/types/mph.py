# <pep8 compliant>

"""
Reads SWTOR 64-bit Morpheme (.mph) files: the animation data the game keeps in
each rig's folder (anim/<category>/<rig>/). They hold the rig's bone names and
which of the rig's bones each channel of an animation drives. 64-bit .jba files
rarely carry bone names themselves, so this is where they come from.

Independent of Blender: nothing here needs bpy or an operator, only paths, so
it can be run and tested on its own.

• find_bone_names(): the bone names of a .jba animation, looked up in a rig's
  folder. Reading every file of a folder takes a while, so results are cached
  per folder for the session.
• find_bone_name_candidates(): every bone order the folder gives an
  animation, for when its sources disagree.
• read_anim_bone_names(): the same information from a single .mph file.
• read_string_table_64(): the 64-bit string table layout, which .jba files
  with their own bone names use as well.
