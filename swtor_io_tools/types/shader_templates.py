"""
Shader template delivery -- replaces the old approach of building every
SWTOR shader's node graph directly via the Python bpy API (see the now-
retired node_group.py / node_tree.py) with appending fully pre-wired
materials from a single bundled template .blend (Atroxa_Shaders.blend).

Why materials, not bare node groups: each template material carries not
just the shader's native node group, but the external Image Texture
nodes, reroutes, and (for Creature/HairC/HairC Modern) the DirectionMapUV
detour, all already positioned -- exactly what shaders_menu.py's old
SWTOR_SHADER_GROUPS 'maps' table used to construct by hand in Python.
Appending the whole material gets all of that for free, and moves layout
maintenance into Blender's own node editor (reviewable by Zero/Koda
directly) instead of a Python coordinate table.

Dedup: bpy.data.libraries.load() has no concept of "this already exists
locally, reuse it" -- every append blindly creates fresh copies of
everything it pulls in, auto-suffixed by Blender's own name-collision
handling (see _append_template_material()'s docstring for the full
append -> remap -> orphan-purge mechanics this requires).
