Lighting template delivery -- appends the bundled "SWTOR_Gobo" Light
data-block from HeroEngine_Shaders.blend, the same append -> remap-group-
nodes-by-exact-name -> orphan-purge mechanism types/shader_templates.py
already uses for materials (see that module's own docstring for the
full "why" -- bpy.data.libraries.load() has no dedup of its own, so
every append needs the same remap step to avoid a fresh, unwanted
".001" copy of the shared node group piling up on every single light).

What's different from the material case, confirmed against a real node
dump of HeroEngine_Shaders.blend's "SWTOR_Gobo" object:

- The template is a Light data-block (AREA type, use_nodes=True), not
  a Material -- so this module works against bpy.data.lights, not
  bpy.data.materials.
- UNLIKE a shader material (one shared node group instance per shader
  TYPE, reused across every material of that type), every light needs
  its own fully independent outer node tree, because each light's own
  three TEX_IMAGE nodes ("rampMap", "Falloff", "illuminationMap") carry
  a genuinely different .dds image per light. Only the shared INNER
  group ("HeroEngine SWTOR - Gobo Lighting" -- this string has to match
  the .blend's own node_tree name exactly) gets deduped; the outer tree and its three texture nodes are
  deliberately left as fresh per-append copies for the caller to
  configure per-instance.
- The shared group's "Color" and "strength" inputs are NOT wired to
  anything internally -- they're plain unconnected sockets with demo
  default values in the template itself, meant to be set directly per
  light instance (confirmed: Emission.Color reads directly from the
  group's own Color input, with no texture multiplied in at all -- the
  three texture maps only feed Emission.Strength via two chained
  MULTIPLY nodes). This module exposes find_group_input_socket() for
  that; it deliberately looks the socket up by its NodeSocket.name
  ("Color"/"strength", kept in sync with the node tree's own Interface
  item names by Blender) rather than by its identifier (e.g.
  "Socket_5") -- socket identifiers are arbitrary and were NOT assigned
  in interface-declaration order in the template as inspected (Color
  came back as "Socket_5", strength as "Socket_6", RampMap as
  "Socket_4" -- non-sequential), so they're not a naming convention
  worth hardcoding against; a future re-export of the template
  regenerating those identifiers would silently break identifier-based
  lookups without changing anything a human would notice.
- The template's "RampMap" group input is confirmed NOT connected to
  anything inside the shared group at all right now (WIP per Crunch) --
  find_texture_node() still exposes the "rampMap" TEX_IMAGE node the
  same as the other two, and callers should still resolve/assign its
  image (cheap, and avoids a second pass through this module once the
  group wiring catches up), just don't expect it to visibly do
  anything yet.

    from HeroEngine_Shaders.blend, dedupes its one shared top-level group
    node (LIGHT_GROUP_NAME) against whatever's already canonical in
    this file, and renames the result to `name`.

    UNLIKE shader_templates.py's get_or_build_shader_material(), this
    does NOT check for or reuse an already-existing same-named Light --
    callers here (see ops/import_room_lights.py's _RealLightCache) are
    responsible for their own build-once-per-distinct-content caching,
    since "one Light data-block per exact JSON value combination" is a
    different dedup key than "one Material per shader type", and lives
    closer to the JSON-parsing caller than to this template-mechanics
    module.

    The caller still owns configuring the result: setting
    light.color/energy/use_shadow directly, the shared group's
    Color/strength inputs (find_group_input_socket()), and each texture
    node's .image (find_texture_node()).

    CONFIRMED REAL BUG this function used to have, now fixed: it used
    to call bpy.data.orphans_purge(do_recursive=True) itself, right
    here, whenever the group-node dedup above actually remapped
    something. bpy.data.orphans_purge() is a GLOBAL sweep -- not scoped
    to anything this function touched -- and this codebase's own
    _MeshCache (see ops/import_area.py) deliberately holds Python-only
    references to mesh data-blocks that can be momentarily real-user-
    free (e.g. right after _reduce_speedtree_lods() deletes a discarded
    LOD's wrapper Object, that LOD's own Mesh data lives on ONLY inside
    _MeshCache's own cache dict until a later instantiate() call gives
    it a fresh Object again). Calling a global purge from anywhere in
    the middle of Area Assembler's main per-element loop -- which is
    exactly where every real light gets built, the first time each
    distinct combination is encountered -- silently deleted exactly
    that kind of intentionally-orphaned-for-now data out from under
    _MeshCache, corrupting its cached Python references into dangling
    StructRNA pointers ("StructRNA of type Mesh has been removed" the
    next time that path was reused). The freshly-appended Light itself
    was equally vulnerable, for the same reason -- it has zero real
    users until the caller wraps it in an Object, which happens AFTER
    this function returns, so an immediate purge here could (and did)
    delete the very Light this function had just built.

    Fixed by not purging here at all -- the now-unreferenced duplicate
    group node_tree(s) this remap leaves behind are harmless bloat
    (unused ID data-blocks, not a correctness problem) until SOMETHING
    eventually purges them. That's the caller's job, at a point in time
    it can guarantee is safe -- ops/import_area.py's ImportAREA.execute()
    runs exactly one bpy.data.orphans_purge() call, once, after every
    single load() call in the whole batch has already finished (same
    timing already proven safe for materials processing, which runs
    strictly after that same loop for the exact same reason).
